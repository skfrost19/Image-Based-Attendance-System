# 2 - Extract faces
# 3 - Save faces to folder
# 4 - Match the faces with records/MRH faces
# 5 - Create a folder if not exists named Attendance
# 6 - In that folder a file named attendance.csv (columns = id, roll_number, name, date)
# 7 - The script will open the file and append the data for each date (if not exists) on each run (if duplicate date then take union of new and old data and replace the column)
